# Inverse-Kinematic-Robot-Arm
A 3-DOF Robot Arm that travels to a given spacial coordinate by calculating angles to each of the servo. One rotation at the base and two rotation at the each of the arms is provided, hence giving it 3-DOF.

The Inverse Kinematics(IK) uses the dhc method in xyz coordinate system to calculate all the angles of the servos.

The drawing for the arms was made in AutoCAD. Aluminium was used to make the arms. 
MG995 and MG948 servos were used for movement. A battery eliminator was used as power supply. 

Pre-Requisites to understand code: Solution of Triangles, Trigonometry.
