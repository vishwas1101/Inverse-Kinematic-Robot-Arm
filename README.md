# Inverse-Kinematic-Robot-Arm
A 3-DOF Robot Arm that travels to a given spacial coordinate by calculating angles to each of the servo. One rotation at the base and two rotation at the each of the arms is provided, hence giving it 3-DOF.

The Inverse Kinematic(IK) currently employs xyz coordinate system to calculate all the angles of the servos.

Pre-Requisites to understand the code: Solution of Triangles, Trigonometry.
